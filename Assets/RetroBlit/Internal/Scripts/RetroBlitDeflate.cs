             * Format notes:
             *
             * - Compressed data that is after the block type if fixed or after the code
             *   description if dynamic is a combination of literals and length/distance
             *   pairs terminated by and end-of-block code.  Literals are simply Huffman
             *   coded bytes.  A length/distance pair is a coded length followed by a
             *   coded distance to represent a string that occurs earlier in the
             *   uncompressed data that occurs again at the current location.
             *
             * - Literals, lengths, and the end-of-block code are combined into a single
             *   code of up to 286 symbols.  They are 256 literals (0..255), 29 length
             *   symbols (257..285), and the end-of-block symbol (256).
             *
             * - There are 256 possible lengths (3..258), and so 29 symbols are not enough
             *   to represent all of those.  Lengths 3..10 and 258 are in fact represented
             *   by just a length symbol.  Lengths 11..257 are represented as a symbol and
             *   some number of extra bits that are added as an integer to the base length
             *   of the length symbol.  The number of extra bits is determined by the base
             *   length symbol.  These are in the static arrays below, lens[] for the base
             *   lengths and lext[] for the corresponding number of extra bits.
             *
             * - The reason that 258 gets its own symbol is that the longest length is used
             *   often in highly redundant files.  Note that 258 can also be coded as the
             *   base value 227 plus the maximum extra value of 31.  While a good deflate
             *   should never do this, it is not an error, and should be decoded properly.
             *
             * - If a length is decoded, including its extra bits if any, then it is
             *   followed a distance code.  There are up to 30 distance symbols.  Again
             *   there are many more possible distances (1..32768), so extra bits are added
             *   to a base value represented by the symbol.  The distances 1..4 get their
             *   own symbol, but the rest require extra bits.  The base distances and
             *   corresponding number of extra bits are below in the static arrays dist[]
             *   and dext[].
             *
             * - Literal bytes are simply written to the output.  A length/distance pair is
             *   an instruction to copy previously uncompressed bytes to the output.  The
             *   copy is from distance bytes back in the output stream, copying for length
             *   bytes.
             *
             * - Distances pointing before the beginning of the output data are not
             *   permitted.
             *
             * - Overlapped copies, where the length is greater than the distance, are
             *   allowed and common.  For example, a distance of one and a length of 258
             *   simply copies the last byte 258 times.  A distance of four and a length of
             *   twelve copies the last four bytes three times.  A simple forward copy
             *   ignoring whether the length is greater than the distance or not implements
             *   this correctly.  You should not use memcpy() since its behavior is not
             *   defined for overlapped arrays.  You should not use memmove() or bcopy()
             *   since though their behavior -is- defined for overlapping arrays, it is
             *   defined to do the wrong thing in this case.

             * Format notes:
             *
             * - A dynamic block starts with a description of the literal/length and
             *   distance codes for that block.  New dynamic blocks allow the compressor to
             *   rapidly adapt to changing data with new codes optimized for that data.
             *
             * - The codes used by the deflate format are "canonical", which means that
             *   the actual bits of the codes are generated in an unambiguous way simply
             *   from the number of bits in each code.  Therefore the code descriptions
             *   are simply a list of code lengths for each symbol.
             *
             * - The code lengths are stored in order for the symbols, so lengths are
             *   provided for each of the literal/length symbols, and for each of the
             *   distance symbols.
             *
             * - If a symbol is not used in the block, this is represented by a zero as
             *   as the code length.  This does not mean a zero-length code, but rather
             *   that no code should be created for this symbol.  There is no way in the
             *   deflate format to represent a zero-length code.
             *
             * - The maximum number of bits in a code is 15, so the possible lengths for
             *   any code are 1..15.
             *
             * - The fact that a length of zero is not permitted for a code has an
             *   interesting consequence.  Normally if only one symbol is used for a given
             *   code, then in fact that code could be represented with zero bits.  However
             *   in deflate, that code has to be at least one bit.  So for example, if
             *   only a single distance base symbol appears in a block, then it will be
             *   represented by a single code of length one, in particular one 0 bit.  This
             *   is an incomplete code, since if a 1 bit is received, it has no meaning,
             *   and should result in an error.  So incomplete distance codes of one symbol
             *   should be permitted, and the receipt of invalid codes should be handled.
             *
             * - It is also possible to have a single literal/length code, but that code
             *   must be the end-of-block code, since every dynamic block has one.  This
             *   is not the most efficient way to create an empty block (an empty fixed
             *   block is fewer bits), but it is allowed by the format.  So incomplete
             *   literal/length codes of one symbol should also be permitted.
             *
             * - If there are only literal codes and no lengths, then there are no distance
             *   codes.  This is represented by one distance code with zero bits.
             *
             * - The list of up to 286 length/literal lengths and up to 30 distance lengths
             *   are themselves compressed using Huffman codes and run-length encoding.  In
             *   the list of code lengths, a 0 symbol means no code, a 1..15 symbol means
             *   that length, and the symbols 16, 17, and 18 are run-length instructions.
             *   Each of 16, 17, and 18 are follwed by extra bits to define the length of
             *   the run.  16 copies the last length 3 to 6 times.  17 represents 3 to 10
             *   zero lengths, and 18 represents 11 to 138 zero lengths.  Unused symbols
             *   are common, hence the special coding for zero lengths.
             *
             * - The symbols for 0..18 are Huffman coded, and so that code must be
             *   described first.  This is simply a sequence of up to 19 three-bit values
             *   representing no code (0) or the code length for that symbol (1..7).
             *
             * - A dynamic block starts with three fixed-size counts from which is computed
             *   the number of literal/length code lengths, the number of distance code
             *   lengths, and the number of code length code lengths (ok, you come up with
             *   a better name!) in the code descriptions.  For the literal/length and
             *   distance codes, lengths after those provided are considered zero, i.e. no
             *   code.  The code length code lengths are received in a permuted order (see
             *   the order[] array below) to make a short code length code length list more
             *   likely.  As it turns out, very short and very long codes are less likely
             *   to be seen in a dynamic code description, hence what may appear initially
             *   to be a peculiar ordering.
             *
             * - Given the number of literal/length code lengths (nlen) and distance code
             *   lengths (ndist), then they are treated as one long list of nlen + ndist
             *   code lengths.  Therefore run-length coding can and often does cross the
             *   boundary between the two sets of lengths.
             *
             * - So to summarize, the code description at the start of a dynamic block is
             *   three counts for the number of code lengths for the literal/length codes,
             *   the distance codes, and the code length codes.  This is followed by the
             *   code length code lengths, three bits each.  This is used to construct the
             *   code length code which is used to read the remainder of the lengths.  Then
             *   the literal/length code lengths and distance lengths are read as a single
             *   set of lengths using the code length codes.  Codes are constructed from
             *   the resulting two sets of lengths, and then finally you can start
             *   decoding actual compressed data in the block.
             *
             * - For reference, a "typical" size for the code description in a dynamic
             *   block is around 80 bytes.
